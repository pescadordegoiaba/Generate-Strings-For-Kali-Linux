1. Imports and Constants:
   - The script starts by importing the necessary modules: `os`, `random`, `string`, `concurrent.futures`, `threading`, `Path`, and `requests`.
   - It defines constants for different types of code generation: `GENERATE_RANDOM_DIGITS`, `GENERATE_RANDOM_PASSWORDS`, `GENERATE_RANDOM_WORDS`, and `GENERATE_ALL`.
   - The constant `RANDOM_WORD_API_URL` holds the URL for the Random Word API, which is used to generate real words for passwords.
   - It creates a semaphore `file_semaphore` using the `threading.Semaphore()` to control access to the shared resource (files).

2. Internet Connection Check:
   - The `has_internet_connection()` function checks if the computer has an active internet connection.
   - It attempts to make a GET request to Google's homepage with a timeout of 5 seconds.
   - If the request is successful, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. Random String Generation:
   - The `generate_random_string_v2(length)` function generates a random string of a specified `length`.
   - It uses the `string.ascii_letters` and `string.digits` to create a pool of characters for generating the random string.
   - The function then selects characters randomly from the pool and concatenates them to form the final random string.

4. Random Password Generation:
   - The `generate_random_password(length)` function generates a random password of a given `length`.
   - It uses `string.ascii_letters`, `string.digits`, and `string.punctuation` to include a variety of characters in the password.
   - The function selects characters randomly from these sets and concatenates them to create the password.

5. Real Word Password Generation:
   - The `generate_real_word_password(destination_path, length)` function generates a password with a real word (if possible) or falls back to generating a random password using `generate_random_password()` if the internet connection is not available or the API fails.
   - If an internet connection is available, the function makes a GET request to the Random Word API with the specified `length`.
   - It then checks if there are any words of the given length in the response.
   - If a real word is found, it saves the word to a file using `save_to_file()` and returns the word as the generated password.
   - If the API fails or no word is found, it prints an error message and returns a randomly generated password.

6. Directory and File Handling:
   - The `create_directory_if_not_exists(directory)` function checks if a directory exists, and if not, it creates it.
   - The `check_existing_code(size, code, destination_path)` function checks if a generated code (password) already exists in the file.
   - It reads the file for codes of the given `size` and compares them to the `code`.
   - If the `code` is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - The `save_to_file(size, code, destination_path)` function saves a generated code to a file, creating a new file if needed.
   - It checks if the code already exists in the file using `check_existing_code()`.
   - If the code does not exist, it writes the code to the file, using a semaphore to control access to the file.

7. Generation and Saving:
   - The `generate_and_save(size, destination_path, generation_type, should_save=True)` function generates a code based on the specified `size` and `generation_type`.
   - It calls the appropriate generation function based on the `generation_type`.
   - If the code already exists, it recursively generates a new code until a unique code is obtained.
   - If `should_save` is `True`, it saves the code to a file using `save_to_file()`.

8. Threaded Generation:
   - The `generate_with_threads(num_threads, destination_path, generation_types, sizes)` function performs multithreaded code generation using the ThreadPoolExecutor from the `concurrent.futures` module.
   - It creates multiple threads to generate codes based on the given `generation_types` and `sizes`.
   - The function uses `generate_and_save()` to generate and save codes in parallel.

9. Main Function:
   - The `main()` function is the entry point of the script.
   - It defines the destination path for saving generated files.
   - It prompts the user for the number of threads and the type of generation they want.
   - It then calls `generate_with_threads()` to start the code generation process.

10. Script Execution:
    - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block checks if the script is being run directly and not imported as a module.
    - If it is the main script, it calls the `main()` function to start the code generation process.

The script allows the user to generate random codes (strings, passwords, or real-word passwords) of different lengths, and it uses multithreading to speed up the generation process. It also ensures that the generated codes are unique and saves them to appropriate files. Additionally, the script handles situations where the API fails or there is no internet connection to generate real-word passwords, falling back to random password generation instead.
